## Problem Statement 
Customers write product reviews on ecommerce websites like Amazon. Amazon processes the reviews to generate commonly occurring tags. But, there exist multiple tags referring to the same thing. The Auto-generated Tags from customer Reviews are pointless and repeating like battery, battery life, battery performance etc. Reviews are not well classified as positive or negative, and same goes with tags/comments

## Solution üí° 

+ Useless or Meaningless Auto-Generated Tags üè∑Ô∏è
+ Reviews not classified as positiveüëç or negative üëé
+ Tags not classified as positiveüëç or negative üëé
+ Repeated Tags üè∑Ô∏èü§î
+ Paid Review Tags that don't reflect sentiments of Customers üò¢
+ Misleading Images that don't match the actual product ‚ùì
+ New Buyer or Potential customer had to go through hundreds of reviews, tags and images to judge the product properly üò≥

## Running Tagonizer Locally 

### Frontend

1. Go to [Release](https://github.com/merrcury/Tagonizer/releases) & Download latest `Tagonizer.zip` file. 
2. Follow the below Given Illustration for setting up extension on Google Chrome running on MacOS. For other OS, it should be pretty similar.

### Backend 

1. First Clone the repository. 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/merrcury/Tagonizer.git
```
2. Navigate into Cloned Repository. 
```bash 
$ cd Tagonizer
```
3. Create Virtual Environment and Activate it. 
```bash 
$ python -m venv venv/
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install Requirements
```bash 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. [Create an Azure resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-call-api) for Text Analytics. Afterwards, [get the key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-call-api) generated for you to authenticate your requests.
6. Set Environment Variable `KEY`, `ENDPOINT`, `LOCATION` with secret token/key, endpoint/base-url and location of resource respectively. 
7. [Create a Computer Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision)  in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click Go to resource.
  + You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
  + You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
  + Save them in Environment as `VKEY` & `VENDPOINT` for both key and endpoint respectively.

8. Run the following command to start backend at `http://localhost:8000/`
```bash
$ uvicorn API.main:app --reload --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```
9. Open `http://localhost:8000/` in browser of your choice. You will be greeted with Swagger UI and further details are present there. 


## Previous Work 
We tried to make extension before but failed terribly. It was laggy, taking down the whole site with it. NLP model was not sufficing in heroku free plan. UI was boring. 

## New Work
New Model for NLP, Modern UI designed on Figma, Added New features like Dark Mode, support for image categorization. Much better server strength. It also ready to ship on chrome store. Remove coding error of memory leaking. We have extensively tested with multiple staging server and staging infra before getting this finally up.
